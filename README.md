# Segmentation-of-OCT-images


This study focuses on improving the diagnosis of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) in eye images using advanced segmentation techniques like U-Net and Mask RCNN. We have used two different methods to analyze OCT images from the Duke University database, enhancing image quality with blurring techniques. The results revealed that U-Net outperformed Mask RCNN in accuracy measures, indicating its effectiveness in DME detection. Overall, this approach aims to contribute to better disease monitoring and treatment strategies for diabetic patients.
